## What you can automate

- Connect LinkedIn, X, Reddit, GitHub, Hacker News, Stack Overflow, and email inboxes in one place.
- Find leads from platform searches, tracked searches, CSV uploads, or OptaReach lead sources.
- Build sequences with actions like view, follow, connect, DM, and AI-personalized replies plus natural wait steps.
- Route contacts down conditional branches (accepted, replied, no response) and keep pacing safe with account health limits.
- Reply fast from Unibox and keep every conversation threaded across channels.

## Key concepts

- **Accounts and warmup**: connect multiple accounts per platform, set limits, and monitor health before scaling volume.
- **Lead sources**: upload CSVs, import OptaReach leads, or save platform searches to auto-refresh new prospects.
- **Tracked searches**: lock in queries for keywords, hashtags, repos, questions, or subreddits and get fresh matches daily.
- **Campaigns and sequences**: drag actions and waits into visual flows; add conditional branches for accepts or replies.
- **Unibox**: handle all replies, mentions, and DMs from every channel in one inbox so nothing slips.

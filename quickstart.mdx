Follow these steps to connect a platform, add leads, and send your first automated outreach.

## Before you begin

- Create an OptaReach account at [optareach.com/register](https://optareach.com/register).
- Have at least one platform login ready (LinkedIn, X, Reddit, GitHub, Hacker News, Stack Overflow, or an email inbox).
- Decide on a narrow audience (keywords, roles, repos, subreddits, or tags) for your first test.

## 1) Create your workspace and connect accounts

1. Go to **Settings > Accounts** and add the platform(s) you want to use. OptaReach supports multiple accounts per channel.
2. Set daily limits and warmup pacing in Account Health to keep sending natural.
3. If you plan to use email, connect via OAuth (Gmail/Outlook) or IMAP/SMTP and set a friendly from-name and signature.

## 2) Add leads

Pick one or more sources:

- **Upload CSV** with names, roles, companies, profile URLs, and emails (if you have them).
- **Platform search** using native filters: LinkedIn search, X hashtags and mentions, Reddit subreddits and keywords, GitHub repos/issues/discussions, Hacker News stories, Stack Overflow tags/questions.
- **Tracked searches** to auto-refresh new matches daily. Save the query to keep your pipeline topped up.
- **OptaReach lead finder** when you want pre-filtered audiences from our database.

OptaReach deduplicates across uploads and searches so you do not re-message the same contact twice.

## 3) Build a sequence

1. Open **Campaigns > New sequence** and choose your platform.
2. Drag actions into the canvas. Common patterns:
   - LinkedIn: View profile → Wait → Like posts → Connect with note → Wait → Message follow-up.
   - X: Track hashtag/mentions → Like/reply → DM with AI-personalized copy.
   - Reddit/GitHub/Hacker News/Stack Overflow: Monitor targets → Post comment/answer → Follow up with DM (where allowed).
   - Email: Multi-step sequence with waits and branch on reply detected.
3. Add **wait steps** between actions to keep pacing human.
4. Use **Social Media GPTs** to draft connection notes, DMs, or replies using profile or post context.
5. Add **conditional branches** for accepted, replied, or no-response paths.

## 4) Launch and monitor

1. Set send windows, daily caps, and safety limits per account.
2. Start the campaign and watch delivery, clicks, accepts, and replies in Campaign Analytics.
3. Handle every response from **Unibox** so threads stay unified across platforms.
4. Pause or edit a sequence at any time; changes apply to leads that have not reached that step yet.

## 5) Keep accounts healthy

- Spread volume across multiple accounts when you scale.
- Keep wait times varied and avoid sending identical copy; lean on GPT variations.
- Monitor Account Health for blocks, throttles, or inbox full signals before increasing volume.

Use OptaReach Email to connect Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or any IMAP/SMTP inbox, then automate personalized sequences with reply detection and deliverability safeguards.

## What you can do

- Connect multiple inboxes with OAuth or IMAP/SMTP credentials.
- Import leads from CSV or from other OptaReach sources (LinkedIn, GitHub, Hacker News, etc.).
- Build multi-step email sequences with waits, reply detection, and conditional branches.
- Track opens, clicks, bounces, and replies per inbox.
- Handle every conversation from **Unibox** alongside your social channels.

## Accounts

- Connect inboxes via OAuth (Gmail/Outlook) or IMAP/SMTP; set sender name, signature, and reply-to.
- Warm up with low caps; increase gradually and rotate across multiple inboxes for volume.
- Add an account:
  1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
  2. Choose **Email** (Gmail/Outlook or IMAP/SMTP) and authenticate.
  3. Set sender name, signature, reply-to, caps; save.

## Leads

- Upload CSVs with name, company, role, email, and social URLs for richer personalization.
- Cross-import leads engaged on other platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub, Reddit, etc.).
- Use OptaReach lead finder filters when you need fresh contacts.

## Campaigns & sequences

1. Create an **Email campaign** and choose sending inbox(es).
2. Select the lead list to enroll (CSV import or cross-imported contacts).
3. Suggested flow:
   - Email 1: short intro, single CTA.
   - Wait 2-4 days.
   - Email 2: value add (resource, code, invite to chat).
   - Wait 3-5 days.
   - Email 3: polite bump, then stop.
4. Turn on **reply detection** so follow-ups halt when someone responds.
5. Personalize with templates and snippets (no GPT on email): keep openings short, reference role/company, and avoid heavy links on the first touch.

## Deliverability and compliance

- Respect send windows and daily caps; avoid sudden volume spikes.
- Honor opt-outs and hard bounces immediately.
- Prefer one clear CTA; limit tracking pixels/links if compliance requires.

## Manage replies

- Replies land in **Unibox** with campaign context.
- Tag/assign conversations and use saved snippets for speed.
- If a lead replies elsewhere, mark them **done** to suppress further email steps.

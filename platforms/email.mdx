Use OptaReach Email to connect Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or any IMAP/SMTP inbox, then automate personalized sequences with reply detection and deliverability safeguards.

## What you can do

- Connect multiple inboxes with OAuth or IMAP/SMTP credentials.
- Import leads from CSV or from other OptaReach sources (LinkedIn, GitHub, Hacker News, etc.).
- Build multi-step email sequences with waits, reply detection, and conditional branches.
- Track opens, clicks, bounces, and replies per inbox.
- Handle every conversation from **Unibox** alongside your social channels.

## Accounts

- Connect inboxes via OAuth (Gmail/Outlook) or IMAP/SMTP; set sender name, signature, and reply-to.
- Warm up with low caps; increase gradually and rotate across multiple inboxes for volume.
- Add an account:
  1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
  2. Choose **Email** (Gmail/Outlook or IMAP/SMTP) and authenticate.
  3. Set sender name, signature, reply-to, caps; save.

## Leads

- Upload CSVs with name, company, role, email, and social URLs for richer personalization.
- Cross-import leads engaged on other platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub, Reddit, etc.).
- Use OptaReach lead finder filters when you need fresh contacts.

## Tracked searches

- Create tracked lead segments inside OptaReach lead finder so new contacts flow in automatically.
- Pair tracked segments with email campaigns to keep top-ups hands-free.

## Campaigns & sequences

1. Create an **Email campaign** and choose sending inbox(es).
2. Select the lead list or tracked segment to enroll.
3. Suggested flow:
   - Email 1: short intro, single CTA.
   - Wait 2–4 days.
   - Email 2: value add (resource, code, invite to chat).
   - Wait 3–5 days.
   - Email 3: polite bump, then stop.
4. Turn on **reply detection** so follow-ups halt when someone responds.

## GPT for Email

- Feed role, company, and recent activity from other channels into prompts for a custom opener.
- Keep outputs concise and plain-text friendly; avoid heavy links on first touch.
- Save presets for intro, value add, and bump to standardize tone.

## Deliverability and compliance

- Respect send windows and daily caps; avoid sudden volume spikes.
- Honor opt-outs and hard bounces immediately.
- Prefer one clear CTA; limit tracking pixels/links if compliance requires.

## Manage replies

- Replies land in **Unibox** with campaign context.
- Tag/assign conversations and respond with GPT presets for speed.
- If a lead replies elsewhere, mark them **done** to suppress further email steps.

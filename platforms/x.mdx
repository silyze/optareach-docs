Use OptaReach to listen for the right conversations on X, engage in-thread, and follow up with personalized DMs at scale.

## What you can do

- Find leads from hashtags, mentions, keywords, and user lists.
- Save **Tracked searches** to watch live conversations and auto-enroll new matches.
- Automate likes, replies, and DMs with per-account limits to stay compliant.
- Draft replies and DMs with **GPT for X** using tweet context.
- Manage every thread from **Unibox** alongside your other channels.

## Accounts

- Connect one or more X accounts and set conservative caps for likes, replies, and DMs while warming up.
- Keep send windows within business hours to reduce spam flags; rotate across accounts to spread volume.
- Add an account:
  1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
  2. Select **X (Twitter)** and authenticate.
  3. Name it, set daily caps for likes/replies/DMs, save.

## Leads

- Pull handles from hashtags, mentions, keywords, and lists.
- Import CSVs with usernames to seed a targeted batch.

## Tracked searches

- Save hashtag/keyword searches so new tweets auto-enroll.
- Use multiple tracked searches (by persona or topic) to diversify sources without rebuilding flows.

## Campaigns & sequences

1. Create an **X campaign** and choose the sending account(s).
2. Select the lead source (tracked search, live search, or CSV).
3. Suggested flow:
   - Like or reply to the triggering tweet with context-aware copy.
   - Wait a natural delay.
   - DM that references the thread.
   - Branch: **Replied** → Unibox; **No response** → single bump; then stop.

## GPT for X

- Feed the tweet text and author bio into your prompt for relevance.
- Keep replies short and link-light; vary templates to avoid repeats.
- Cap length in prompts (e.g., “max 220 characters”) to stay native to X.

## Monitor and respond

- Track replies, clicks, and limit warnings in Campaign Analytics.
- Manage threads and DMs in **Unibox** to keep context.
- If you hit rate limits, pause the account, lower caps, and stagger schedules across accounts.

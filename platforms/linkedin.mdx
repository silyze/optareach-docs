OptaReach lets you automate LinkedIn outreach while keeping pacing natural. Use visual nodes for views, follows, connects, and messages, then branch based on accepts or replies.

## What you can do

- Connect and manage multiple LinkedIn accounts at once.
- Pull leads from CSVs, LinkedIn search with advanced filters, tracked searches, or OptaReach lead data.
- Build sequences with **View Profile**, **Follow**, **Connect**, **Message**, and **Wait** steps.
- Route contacts down different paths based on **Accepted**, **Replied**, or **No response**.
- Draft connection notes and follow-ups with **Social Media GPTs** using profile context.

## Accounts

- Connect one or more LinkedIn accounts in **Settings > Accounts** and start with low daily caps during warmup.
- Keep account health green by spacing actions (views/likes/connects/messages) and honoring send windows.
- Add an account (click-by-click):
  1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
  2. Choose **LinkedIn** and authenticate.
  3. Name the account (e.g., “AE-LI-1”), set daily caps, and save.

## Leads

- Import CSVs with profile URLs, roles, and companies for enrichment.
- Pull prospects directly from LinkedIn search filters (role, industry, geo, seniority).

## Tracked searches

- Save your best LinkedIn searches so new matches flow in automatically.
- Attach a tracked search to a campaign to auto-enroll fresh leads without rebuilding the sequence.

## Campaigns & sequences

1. Create a **LinkedIn campaign** and pick the sending account(s).
2. Choose the lead source (tracked search, live search, or static list).
3. Suggested starter flow:
   - View profile → Wait 1–2 days → Like 2–3 posts → Wait 1–2 days → Connect with note → Wait 2–3 days → Message follow-up.
4. Add branches:
   - **Accepted**: send a welcome/value drop.
   - **Replied**: notify a human or move to Unibox.
   - **No response**: one gentle bump, then stop.

## GPT for LinkedIn

- Use profile fields (headline, recent activity) in your prompt for contextual notes.
- Keep connection notes to 1–2 lines and vary tone/templates to avoid repeats.
- Pre-review GPT output before launch; shorten if acceptance drops.

## Monitor and respond

- Watch accepts/replies and limit warnings in Campaign Analytics.
- Handle replies inside **Unibox** so conversations stay threaded.
- If performance dips, refresh tracked searches, slow pacing, and rotate across multiple accounts.

Use OptaReach to spot the right Stack Overflow questions, post credible answers, and nurture relationships with responders.

## What you can do

- Save **Tracked questions** for tags, keywords, or technologies you support.
- Draft high-quality answers with **GPT for Stack Overflow** and review before posting.
- Monitor multiple accounts and reputation impact while staying within rate limits.
- Funnel replies and comments into **Unibox** for follow-up.

## Accounts

- Connect your Stack Overflow account and keep daily caps modest for answers/comments.
- Monitor reputation and flags; slow down if quality signals drop.
- Add an account:
  1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
  2. Pick **Stack Overflow** and authenticate.
  3. Name it, set daily caps, save.

## Leads

- Import question URLs and user handles via CSV if you have a target list.
- Use tag/keyword searches to pull relevant questions matching your domain.

## Tracked searches

- Save tag-based searches (e.g., `python`, `kubernetes`, your SDK) to feed new questions automatically.
- Segment tracked searches by intent (bug reports, how-to, architecture) for tailored answers.

## Campaigns & sequences

1. Create a **Stack Overflow campaign** and select the sending account.
2. Choose lead source (tracked questions, live search, or CSV).
3. Suggested flow:
   - Draft an answer (review and test before posting).
   - Post the answer; optionally leave a short follow-up comment.
   - Wait several hours to a day.
   - Branch: **Replied/commented** → Unibox and human follow-up; **No response** → stop (avoid bumping).
4. Avoid links unless they directly solve the question; lead with working code.

## GPT for Stack Overflow

- Provide the full question body to GPT; require concise, correct code with comments.
- Add guardrails: “no hallucinated APIs”, “include minimal reproducible snippet”, “cite version”.
- Use different presets for quick fixes vs. architectural guidance.

## Monitor and respond

- Track accepted answers, upvotes, and replies in Campaign Analytics.
- Respond via **Unibox** to keep conversation context tied to the question.
- If you see downvotes/flags, pause, improve answer quality, and reduce volume.

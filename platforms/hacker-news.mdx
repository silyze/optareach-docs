## What you can do

- Save **Tracked discussions** for keywords, domains, or topics you care about.
- Auto-detect new threads and comment with value-first responses.
- Use **GPT for Hacker News** to summarize the discussion and draft concise replies.
- Route replies into **Unibox** so you can keep the conversation moving.

## Accounts

- Connect your HN account and set low daily caps for comments.
- Watch karma/flag signals; slow down if quality or reputation dips.
- Add an account:
  1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
  2. Select **Hacker News** and authenticate.
  3. Name it, set daily caps, save.

## Leads

- Import CSVs of usernames and discussion URLs you want to engage.
- Target stories and threads that match your ICP or problem space.

## Tracked searches

- Save keyword/domain/topic searches (e.g., “DevOps”, “LLM evals”, competitor domains) to auto-pull new stories.
- Use separate tracked searches for technical vs. business topics to route to the right sequences.

## Campaigns & sequences

1. Create a **Hacker News campaign** and pick the sending account.
2. Choose lead source (tracked discussion, live search, or CSV).
3. Suggested flow:
   - Post a concise, helpful comment referencing the story or parent.
   - Wait a few hours.
   - If interest appears, reply again or invite a DM/email with a light CTA.
   - Branch: **Replied** → Unibox; **No response** → stop (avoid over-posting).

## GPT for Hacker News

- Ask GPT for a 1–3 sentence, neutral, technical reply; avoid hype or marketing language.
- Include the story title and key comment text in the prompt; cap length to keep it succinct.
- Create two presets: quick take and deeper technical response.

## Monitor and respond

- Track which topics drive replies in Campaign Analytics.
- Reply from **Unibox** to keep context; stay link-light to avoid flags.
- If karma drops or flags rise, pause, tighten quality, and reduce volume.

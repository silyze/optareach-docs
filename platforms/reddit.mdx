OptaReach keeps you in the conversations that matter on Reddit. Track keywords, reply with on-brand comments, and route interested users into DM follow-ups.

## What you can do

- Save tracked searches across subreddits, keywords, and authors to surface new threads in real time.
- Automate comment replies and optional DMs while respecting subreddit pacing.
- Manage multiple Reddit accounts and monitor health to avoid rate limits.
- Use **GPT for Reddit** to draft authentic, context-aware replies.
- Handle every message and DM from **Unibox**.

## Accounts

- Connect one or more Reddit accounts and set low daily caps for comments and DMs.
- Respect subreddit pacing; spread activity across accounts if you post frequently.
- Add an account:
  1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
  2. Pick **Reddit** and authenticate.
  3. Name it, set comment/DM caps, save.

## Leads

- Import CSVs with usernames and relevant thread URLs.
- Pull targets from subreddit + keyword filters that match your ICP.

## Tracked searches

- Save subreddit/keyword searches to auto-capture new threads daily.
- Segment tracked searches by intent (questions, tool requests, competitor mentions) for tighter routing.

## Campaigns & sequences

1. Create a **Reddit campaign** and pick sending account(s).
2. Choose a lead source (tracked search, live search, or CSV).
3. Suggested flow:
   - Comment with an authentic, helpful reply.
   - Wait a few hours.
   - If rules allow, DM referencing the thread.
   - Branch: **Replied** → handoff in Unibox; **No response** → optional single bump, then stop.

## GPT for Reddit

- Pull the post text and subreddit context into your prompt; keep tone community-friendly.
- Avoid promotional language; focus on solving the OP’s problem.
- Rotate presets per subreddit persona to avoid repetition.

## Monitor and respond

- Track which subreddits/keywords drive replies in Campaign Analytics.
- Manage DMs and follow-ups in **Unibox** to keep context linked to the thread.
- If rate limits appear, pause, lower caps, and lengthen waits.

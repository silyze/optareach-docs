OptaReach helps you spot developers who match your ICP and reach them inside the GitHub ecosystem before moving to DM or email.

## What you can do

- Discover leads from repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions that match your keywords or tech stack.
- Save **Tracked searches** for repos or topics and get new matches automatically.
- Monitor multiple GitHub accounts and respect rate limits.
- Use **GPT for GitHub** to summarize a thread and draft replies that add value.
- Manage all replies and follow-ups from **Unibox**.

## Accounts

- Connect one or more GitHub accounts; set conservative caps for comments and DMs.
- Watch rate limits/API quotas and spread activity across accounts if needed.
- Add an account:
  1. Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
  2. Choose **GitHub** and authenticate.
  3. Name it, set daily caps, save.

## Leads

- Import contributor lists via CSV (usernames + repo/issue URLs).
- Discover targets from repos, issues, PRs, and discussions that match your keywords or tech stack.

## Tracked searches

- Save searches for repos, orgs, languages, or issue keywords to auto-surface new activity.
- Attach tracked searches to campaigns so fresh threads flow in without manual pulls.

## Campaigns & sequences

1. Create a **GitHub campaign** and choose sending account(s).
2. Pick a lead source (tracked search, live search, or CSV).
3. Suggested flow:
   - Comment on the issue/PR/discussion with a helpful, technical reply.
   - Wait ~1 day.
   - If appropriate, DM the contributor or move them to email.
   - Branch: **Replied** → human follow-up in Unibox; **No response** → optional single bump.

## GPT for GitHub

- Feed issue/PR/discussion text into GPT; ask for concise, code-aware responses.
- Include guardrails (no hallucinated APIs, cite code snippet/line) in prompts.
- Keep tone technical and specific; avoid boilerplate praise.

## Monitor and respond

- Track which repos/topics convert in Campaign Analytics.
- Keep GitHub threads and DMs organized in **Unibox**.
- If limits trigger, lower caps, extend waits, or rotate accounts.

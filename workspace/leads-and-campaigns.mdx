Use these steps to keep your pipeline full, build repeatable outreach flows, and respond quickly.

## Add leads

- **CSV upload**: include first/last name, role, company, and profile URL; add emails when available.
- **Platform search**: pull prospects directly from LinkedIn search, X hashtags/mentions, Reddit keywords, GitHub repos/issues/discussions, Hacker News stories, and Stack Overflow tags/questions.
- **Tracked searches**: save any search so new matches flow in automatically each day.
- **Cross-import**: reuse leads discovered on one platform inside another (for example, send an email to a GitHub user you engaged with).
- OptaReach deduplicates across uploads and searches to avoid double messaging.

## Build a campaign

1. Choose the **platform** and the **account(s)** to send from.
2. Select a **lead source**: static list, live tracked search, or a filtered segment.
3. Drag actions into the sequence:
   - LinkedIn: view profile, follow, connect with note, message, waits.
   - X: like, reply, DM, waits.
   - Reddit/GitHub/Hacker News/Stack Overflow: comment or answer, optional follow-up DM (where allowed), waits.
   - Email: multi-step email touches with reply detection.
4. Add **wait steps** to keep pacing natural and comply with platform limits.
5. Define **conditions** (accepted, replied, no response) to branch follow-ups automatically.

## Personalize with Social Media GPTs

- Insert profile, post, or thread context and let GPT generate a draft.
- Save favorite prompts as presets so your team can reuse them.
- Add guardrails: tone of voice, CTA, and max length to keep messages on-brand.

## Send windows and caps

- Set daily caps per account and per campaign.
- Limit sending windows to business hours in the recipient’s timezone when possible.
- Stagger start times across accounts to look organic.

## Monitor and respond in Unibox

- Every reply, mention, DM, or email response lands in **Unibox** with platform context.
- Filter by campaign, account, or status (unread, needs follow-up, closed).
- Reply inline with saved GPT prompts, or hand off to a teammate.

## Measure and improve

- Use Campaign Analytics to track delivery, accepts, replies, and conversions.
- Pause or edit active sequences; changes apply to contacts that have not reached that step yet.
- Archive stale tracked searches and raise limits gradually once health metrics stay green.

OptaReach is multi-account by design. Connect all of the profiles you want to use, apply per-account limits, and reuse the same saved searches across them.

## Supported platforms

- LinkedIn
- X (Twitter)
- Reddit
- GitHub
- Hacker News
- Stack Overflow
- Email inboxes (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or any IMAP/SMTP)

## Connect an account

1. Go to **Settings > Accounts** and pick a platform.
2. Authenticate with the platform login (OAuth where supported; otherwise provide the required tokens or cookies).
3. Name the account so you can route campaigns to it later (for example “AE-LinkedIn-1”).
4. Repeat for any additional accounts you want to use; OptaReach will balance volume across them when you choose multiple.

## Set health and safety limits

- Use **Account Health** to set max actions per day and per hour for each channel.
- Start low while warming up: light profile views/likes before sending messages.
- Enable wait steps between actions in sequences so pacing stays human.
- If a platform signals throttling or rate limits, pause the account and lower the caps before resuming.

## Tracked searches

- Save your best platform queries (LinkedIn filters, X hashtags/mentions, Reddit keywords, GitHub repos/issues/discussions, HN topics, Stack Overflow tags).
- OptaReach refreshes tracked searches daily and surfaces new leads without re-running the query yourself.
- Attach a tracked search to a campaign so new matches are automatically enrolled.

## Switching accounts per campaign

- When creating a campaign, choose the account(s) to send from. Use separate accounts for different audiences or geographies.
- For email, you can set sender identity, signature, and reply-to per account.
- If an account is paused or unhealthy, OptaReach skips it and continues with the remaining connected accounts.

## Troubleshooting

- **Login failed**: re-authenticate and confirm 2FA is complete on the source platform.
- **Actions not sending**: check daily caps, send windows, and whether the account is paused for safety.
- **Duplicate leads**: OptaReach dedupes across accounts; if you import the same contact twice, it will be skipped on subsequent runs.
